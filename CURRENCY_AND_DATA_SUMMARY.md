# 💰 Currency Conversion & Data Sources - Complete Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Currency Conversion to Indian Rupees (₹)**

All prices throughout the application are now displayed in **Indian Rupees (INR)** instead of USD.

**Conversion Rate:** 1 USD = ₹83.50 (configurable)

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `client/utils/currency.js` - NEW utility file for currency conversion
- ✅ `client/components/ProductCard.js` - All prices converted to ₹
- ✅ `client/components/Dashboard.js` - Revenue/profit in ₹
- ✅ `client/components/ActivityFeed.js` - All price events in ₹
- ✅ `client/components/PricingFactors.js` - Factor details in ₹
- ✅ `client/components/ProductModal.js` - Modal prices in ₹
- ✅ `client/components/Header.js` - Currency indicator added

**What You'll See:**
- Header shows: "Currency: INR" with "1 USD = ₹83.50"
- All product prices: ₹4,175.00 instead of $50.00
- Dashboard metrics: ₹12.5K, ₹2.3L, ₹1.2Cr (K/L/Cr notation)
- Activity feed: Old ₹4,175.00 → New ₹4,592.50
- Pricing factors: Cost: ₹2,920.00

## 📊 Data Sources Explained

### **Important:** This system uses **INTERNAL SIMULATION** (not external APIs)

The data is generated by the system itself to demonstrate AI pricing logic without external dependencies.

### **4 Main Data Generators:**

#### 1. **Customer Interaction Simulator**
**File:** `server/simulation/dataGenerator.js`

**Generates:**
- Product views
- Cart additions
- Purchases
- Bounce events

**Frequency:** Every 2-5 seconds

**Algorithm:**
- Weighted random selection
- Products with lower prices get more views
- Peak hours (10am-2pm, 6pm-10pm) get 2x traffic
- Weekends get 1.5x traffic

**Real-world equivalent:**
- Google Analytics
- Mixpanel
- Segment
- Custom event tracking

---

#### 2. **Competitor Price Simulator**
**File:** `server/simulation/dataGenerator.js`

**Generates:**
- 5 competitor prices per product
- Realistic price fluctuations (±5-10%)

**Frequency:** Every 10-20 seconds

**Competitors:**
1. Amazon India
2. Flipkart
3. Myntra
4. Snapdeal
5. Meesho

**Real-world equivalent:**
- Prisync
- Competera
- Web scraping services
- Price monitoring APIs

---

#### 3. **Purchase Event Generator**
**File:** `server/simulation/dataGenerator.js`

**Generates:**
- Purchase transactions
- Revenue calculations
- Inventory reduction
- Profit tracking

**Frequency:** Every 5-15 seconds

**Algorithm:**
- Purchase probability based on demand + price competitiveness
- Reduces inventory by 1-3 units
- Calculates revenue and profit

**Real-world equivalent:**
- Razorpay webhooks
- Stripe webhooks
- Payment gateway integrations
- Order management systems

---

#### 4. **ML Demand Predictor**
**File:** `server/ml/demandPredictor.js`

**Analyzes 8 Features:**
1. Price position vs competitors
2. Stock ratio (current/initial)
3. Interaction score (views + cart + purchases)
4. Competitor advantage
5. Margin ratio
6. Recent sales velocity
7. Time of day
8. Day of week

**Output:**
- Demand score (0-100)
- Confidence level (0-1)

**Real-world equivalent:**
- Custom ML models
- AWS SageMaker
- Google AI Platform
- Azure ML

## 🎓 For Jury Presentation

### **Script:**

> "This system demonstrates a complete dynamic pricing pipeline using **simulated real-time data**. 
>
> **Data Sources:**
> - Customer interactions are simulated every 2-5 seconds
> - Competitor prices update every 10-20 seconds
> - Purchases occur every 5-15 seconds
> - All data is stored in a SQLite database
>
> **In Production:**
> These simulations would be replaced with:
> - Real customer analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
> - Competitor price APIs (Prisync, Competera)
> - Live inventory systems (ERP integration)
> - Transaction data (Razorpay, Stripe webhooks)
>
> **The AI pricing logic is production-ready** and would work identically with real data sources.
>
> **Currency:**
> All prices are displayed in Indian Rupees (₹) at a conversion rate of ₹83.50 per USD, making it relevant for Indian e-commerce."
